The key objectives of this project include: 

1) **Tracking:** Enabling healthcare providers to track patient health as per previously updated medical records.

2) **Secure Data Storage:** System ensures confidentiality, integrity, and availability of patient health data through data encryption, authentication, and access control measures.

3) **Seamless Data Management:** System provides tools and features for healthcare providers to easily manage patient health data, including tracking of previous health, demographics, medical history, treatments, medications, allergies and other relevant information. System supports real-time access to patient health data, providing healthcare providers with comprehensive and up-to-date information.

5) **Ease of Communication:** System enables patients to communicate with the doctor directly through chat.  

6) **Patient view:** Keeping in mind the requirements of a diagnosis, the system provides patients with the facility of uploading reports, viewing current prescription, previous reports and current weekly schedule.  
## Methadology

In the digital healthcare landscape, effective management of patient health data is critical to ensure the delivery of safe, efficient, and quality care. As healthcare organisations strive to adopt Electronic Health Records (EHRs), comply with regulatory requirements, and leverage data-driven insights, such a system becomes essential.

The implementation of this system includes PHP for the website(frontend and backend), deployed on Google Cloud, furthermore used LAMP service by Google Cloud. Our system has three modules, within which further services are being provided. To be specific:



**Patient Login:**
  - My Profile
  - Dashboard
  - Your Prescription
  - Your Reports
  - Upload other reports

**Doctor Login:**
   - Weekly Schedule (Dashboard)
   - Patient Details
 - Chat with patient
