## Team : The Lifesavers (GeeksforGeeks Hackathon)
# Lifeline (Hospital Management System)
Our system streamlines healthcare providers' workflow, promoting data privacy and ensuring high-quality patient care. It offers a user-friendly interface for doctors to access and edit patient health data while maintaining data security. Access is restricted to authorized personnel through role-based permissions and multi-factor authentication. Our system adheres to industry standards for data privacy and security and ensures seamless data exchange and consistency in patient records. Implemented using PHP on Google Cloud using LAMP service.


## Objective

The key objectives of this project include: 

1) **Tracking:** Enabling healthcare providers to track patient health as per previously updated medical records.

2) **Secure Data Storage:** System ensures confidentiality, integrity, and availability of patient health data through data encryption, authentication, and access control measures.

3) **Seamless Data Management:** System provides tools and features for healthcare providers to easily manage patient health data, including tracking of previous health, demographics, medical history, treatments, medications, allergies and other relevant information. System supports real-time access to patient health data, providing healthcare providers with comprehensive and up-to-date information.  

4) **Enhanced Patient Care:** System aims to improve patient care by ensuring that healthcare providers have access to complete and accurate patient health data at the point of care. This facilitates better care coordination, reduces errors, and enhances patient safety and satisfaction. 

5) **Ease of Communication:** System enables patients to communicate with the doctor directly through chat.  

6) **Patient view:** Keeping in mind the requirements of a diagnosis, the system provides patients with the facility of uploading reports, viewing current prescription, previous reports and current weekly schedule.  
## Methadology

In the digital healthcare landscape, effective management of patient health data is critical to ensure the delivery of safe, efficient, and quality care. As healthcare organisations strive to adopt Electronic Health Records (EHRs), comply with regulatory requirements, and leverage data-driven insights, such a system becomes essential.

The implementation of this system includes PHP for the website(frontend and backend), deployed on Google Cloud, furthermore used LAMP service by Google Cloud. Our system has three modules, within which further services are being provided. To be specific:



**Patient Login:**
  - My Profile
  - Dashboard
  - Your Prescription
  - Your Reports
  - Upload other reports
  - Contact

**Doctor Login:**
   - Weekly Schedule (Dashboard)
   - Patient Details
 - Chat with patient
 - Patient Prescription
- Patient Report
- Patient Documents

**Admin Login:**
- Register New Patient
- Generate Case ID

## Results

The system homepage is the main landing page that provides an overview of our services, and offerings. It is designed to provide a user-friendly experience and help one easily navigate through the website.
